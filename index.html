     <h1 id="h1">Marinette Dupain-Cheng is a fictional superhero and the female protagonist of the animated television series Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir created by Thomas Astruc. She is depicted as a French-Chinese teenage student that aspires to become a fashion designer and whose parents own a bakery. After she passes the test of Master Fu, the keeper of the magical objects named the Miraculouses, by helping him, Marinette is chosen as a soon-to-be superhero alongside Cat Noir. As a result, she is given a pair of earrings known as the Ladybug Miraculous, which when worn grants Marinette the ability to transform into Ladybug, her superhero alias. Ladybug and Cat Noir's goal is to protect Paris from the villain Hawk Moth and defeat him altogether.</h1>
